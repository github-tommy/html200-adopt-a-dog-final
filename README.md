Testing has been done with 3 different browsers and 2 different platforms to ensure the site quality and compatibility.

Operating systems: Mac and PC.

Different viewing modes have been taken into consideration when designing the website to meet the device preferences of the different user personas:
1. mobile
2. tablet and 
3. desktop.

Developer's inspect element is also used throughout the process. A 2-dog-tile layout is displayed on a tablet-mode for best, optimum viewing while a 1-dog-tile layout for mobile-mode viewing.
